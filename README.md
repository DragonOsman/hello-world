My first repository on GitHub; and, of course, it's the generic "Hello World" thingamagig

My name is Osman Zakir and I'm currently learning programming.  I've done some C and C++ tutorials and will continue the C++ ones until I've mastered the language, but first I want to go into web development (front-end and back end), and hopefully also learn some web designing with Photoshop.
